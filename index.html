                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                        This paper examines the challenging problem of new user cold starts in subset labelled and extremely 
                        sparsely labelled big data. We introduce a new Isle of Wight Supply Chain (IWSC) dataset demonstrating 
                        these characteristics. We also introduce a new technique addressing these challenges, the Transitive 
                        Semantic Relationships (TSR) model, which infers potential relationships from user and item text content 
                        and few labelled examples. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We perform both implicit and explicit evaluation of TSR as a recommender system and from new user cold 
                        starts we achieve a hit-rate@10 of 77% on a collection of 630 items with only 376 supply-chain consumer 
                        labels, and 67% with only 142 supply-chain supplier labels, demonstrating a high level of performance 
                        even with extremely few labels in challenging cold-start scenarios. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TSR is suitable for any dataset featuring few labels and user and item content, where similarity of content 
                        indicates similar relationship forming capability. TSR can be used as a standalone recommender system 
                        or to complement existing high-performance recommender models that require more labels or do not support 
                        cold starts.

                    <h1>Recommendations from Cold Starts in Big Data</h1>                
                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this paper, we introduce Transitive Semantic Relationships (TSR), a new technique for ranking 
                        recommendations from cold-starts in datasets with very sparse, partial labelling, by making use 
                        of semantic embeddings of auxiliary information, in this case, textual item descriptions. We also 
                        introduce a new dataset on the Isle of Wight Supply Chain (IWSC), which we use to demonstrate the 
                        new technique. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We achieve a cold start hit rate @10 of 77% on a collection of 630 items with only 
                        376 supply-chain supplier labels, and 67% with only 142 supply-chain consumer labels, demonstrating 
                        a high level of performance even with extremely few labels in challenging cold-start scenarios. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The TSR technique is generalisable to any dataset where items with similar description text share 
                        similar relationships and has applications in speculatively expanding the number of relationships 
                        in partially labelled datasets and highlighting potential items of interest for human review. The 
                        technique is also appropriate for use as a recommendation algorithm, either standalone or 
                        supporting traditional recommender systems in difficult cold-start situations.

                        RESTeasy is a dependency-free front-end JavaScript micro-framework for REST API powered CMS (Content Management System) websites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RESTeasy lets you focus on markup and styling by abstracting away all the boilerplate JavaScript for communicating with your REST API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RESTeasy can:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Display resources in a table, with support for searching and pagination</li>
                            <li>Populate a form with the item selected in the table</li>
                            <li>Save changes to the selected item</li>
                            <li>Delete the selected item</li>
                            <li>Create new items</li>
                            <li>Display status and error messages</li>
                        </ul>
                        All without you writing any JavaScript (other than initializing RESTeasy).

                        ARMAS is an Augmented Reality Mobile Asbestos Survey tool 
                        created in collaboration with Hampshire Scientific Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was the dissertation project for my undergraduate degree at the University of Portsmouth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app is built for Android mobile devices, and is optimised for use on both phones and tablets. 
                        It utilises <a href="https://www.wikitude.com/">Wikitude</a> to provide an augmented reality interface for highlighting known asbestos locations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app was demonstrated at the university's student conference March 2016, 
                        and has since been taken forward by a new group of students.

                        A custom implementation of a genetic algorithm simulator in Java. 
                        The program allows for custom fitness functions and generates a detailed output log of the simulation, 
                        making it an ideal learning tool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The GUI allows for input of a custom fitness function (currently 1 dimensional only), 
                        as well as selection of population size (population is always constant between generations), 
                        elitism, mutation chance, and optional sigma scaling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A number of stopping conditions are supported, including 'known best' and max-generations.
                        The program utilises a thread pool with an optional number of workers.

                        An attempt to make a simple Rogue-like game using VB Windows forms. 
                        The game features procedural building and creature placement, an item system, 
                        and a detailed tile description system.

                        Note: This is a very old project form my first year of college and as such is quite poorly implemented.
                        The project is not a serious attempt at making a functional game, more a proof of concept.

                    <p>A paper on high-precision location estimation I wrote during my undergraduate studies.</p>
                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                        A number of different methods and technologies exist for determining the location of mobile devices. 
                        Depending on the desired usage, a different subset of these may be suitable for a given project. 
                        One of the key issues in location detection is the degree of precision to which these tools remain accurate 
                        and additionally the reliability of that data. For some usages, such as markerless augmented reality, 
                        requiring accuracy to within a few meters, typical solutions such as GPS may not be sufficient 
                        and alternatives must be considered. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This paper will evaluate and compare technologies and tools for mobile devices, 
                        such as smartphones and tablets, to accurately determine their location to within 5 meters or less with consideration 
                        for different environments and conditions in which they may need to operate given different use cases. 
                        Techniques for ensuring operability in challenging environments will be discussed.
