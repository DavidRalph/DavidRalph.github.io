                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a student at the University of Portsmouth, studying for my Master's in Computer Science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As professional and enthusiast programmer, I work on projects both for utility and fun. 
                    A number of my academic and side-project can be found here, and one day I might even start a blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a keen interest in cognitive computing, machine learning, data science, and the semantic web. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I believe strongly in the importance of Free and Open Source software, 
                    and the full source code to most of my projects can be found on GitHub.
                </p>
                <h2>About my projects</h2>
                <p>
                    All my PHP and Node.JS projects adhere to RESTful design practices and I endeavour to make 
                    all my HTML code as semantic as possible. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I am always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement,

                    As VP Tech for the University of Portsmouth IT Society, 
                    I have created a number of projects for demonstrative and educational purposes, 
                    to aid in my teaching of student workshops, all of these can be found here.

                        ARMAS is an Augmented Reality Mobile Asbestos Survey tool 
                        created in collaboration with Hampshire Scientific Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was created for my dissertation project for my undergraduate degree at the University of Portsmouth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app is built for Android mobile devices, and is optimised for use on both phones and tablets. 
                        It utilises Wikitude to provide an augmented reality interface for highlighting known asbestos locations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The app was demonstrated at the university's student conference March 2016, 
                        and is now being taken forward by a new group of students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More information about the project will be added here in future.

                        A custom implementation of a genetic algorithm simulator in Java. 
                        The program allows for custom fitness functions and generates a detailed output log of the simulation, 
                        making it an ideal learning tool.

                    <p>
                        The GUI allows for input of a custom fitness function (currently 1 dimensional only), 
                        as well as selection of population size (population is always constant between generations), 
                        elitism, mutation chance, and optional sigma scaling.

                    <p>
                        A number of stopping conditions are supported, including 'known best' and max-generations.
                        The program utilises a thread pool with an optional number of workers.

                        This project demonstrates use of WebGL to render a 3D Earth model with an orbiting satellite, 
                        without the use of any libraries (other than WebGL).

                        The scene features full camera controls and orbital controls for the satellite.

                        This Java EE web application can be used to calculate the degree classification 
                        that would be awarded to an MEng student at the University of Portsmouth based on a set of unit grades.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I created this as while grade calculators exist for most other courses, there was not yet one for MEng courses.

                        An attempt to make a simple Rogue-like game using VB Windows forms. 
                        The game features procedural building and creature placement, an item system, 
                        and a detailed tile description system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: This is a very old project form my first year of college and as such is quite poorly implemented.
                        The project is not a serious attempt at making a functional game, but more of a proof of concept.
